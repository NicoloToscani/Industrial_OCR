# Android Optical Character Recognition 
Android application for text detection that uses OpenCV for image enhancement and Google Tesseract Engine for optical character recognition. 

It's possibile analyze an image loaded from device gallery or through live frames acquired by the camera. In both cases you can enhance the image to improve character recognition using:
* smoothing filters
* sharpening filters
* gray scale conversion
* histogram equalization
* rescaling
* binarization
* morphological transformations 

After an OCR recognition it is possible to apply an OCV check to verify the recognized words with the searched values.
